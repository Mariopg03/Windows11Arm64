Windows 11 Iso - Pro and Home version - Only for Arm64 - Compatible with Mac M1 and M2

This version of Windows is not official from Microsoft, it is an adaptation of the software provided by Microsoft to make it work on arm devices.
It is recommended to install in a virtual machine, using vmware, it can also be installed in a disk partition natively, generating a dual boot in the system.

Currently the version only has the English translation, but it is fully functional and has all existing keyboard layouts.

In order to use the product, it is necessary to download the file with the .iso extension and perform the installation.
To be able to create a flash drive I recommend using the rufus program.
